                                <p class="mb-4 text-justify">CareHome is a health-related service with the help of telecommunication 
and electronic information technologies. It refers to the whole collection of 
deliverables designed to enable patients and their physicians or healthcare 
providers. It has a wide range of uses, including online patient consultations, 
remote control, telehealth nursing, and remote physical and psychiatry 
rehabilitation. It allows better health care choices, increases emergency service 
quality and performance, reduces time in making a diagnosis, and saves costs for 
both doctors and patients by optimizing clinical procedures and reducing travel 
expenses to hospitals.
Carehome has increased access to high-quality healthcare facilities. 
Patients will now get more customized clinical services. They can also meet the 
best medical providers simply by using video application software, consultations 
can be taken from afar, and clinicians have better-suited tools for networking, data 
storage, report management, and leveraging each other's specific skills. This 
improves the quality of medical practice, allowing doctors to spend less time on 
 3
rural assignments and providing more care to patients. Also enables private 
healthcare specialists to practice and will enhance the patient experience. Patients 
will no longer have to stand in long queues, and physicians will be able to access 
patient information more conveniently and efficiently with electronic files and 
eliminating overall wait times. Furthermore, remote appointments allow doctors to 
devote less time to each patient, allowing them to treat a more significant number 
of patients.
So our business aims to supply these medical services to patients through 
online. We decide to build E-commerce web platform for that.</p>
